# Creating a Chatbot with Keras and TensorFlow

The following project is intended to get further practice building neural nets. I will be using an intents database focusing on adverse reactions and blood pressure help. 

The model was train, and we were able to accomplish 100% accuracy. 

# How to reproduce this project?

Steps:
1. Clone the contents of this repo
1. In your terminal, run `python main.py`
1. Once the model is created, run `python chatapp.py`. This will launch the GUI app using Tkinter.

## Further improvements

Now that I have a better understanding of how to us neural nets to build chatbots, my next project is to actually build my own intents database, and apply the same logic to create a more personalize chatbot. 

Intended length the project: 3 days

## Tools used:

1. Python
1. TenserFlow
1. Keras
1. Pandas
1. Numpy
1. Tkinter / Flask
